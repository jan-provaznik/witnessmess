WITNESS MESS provides procedures for witnessing genuine multi-partite
entanglement from a subset of marginalia both in multi-partite qubit systems
and multi-mode continuous variable Gaussian systems.

Examples

  See the examples directory. Both discrete and continuous variable examples
  are provided.

Documentation

  The documentation is left as exercise for the reader.
