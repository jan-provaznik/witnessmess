The concept of genuine multipartite entanglement has been investigated for
continuous variable quantum systems. We demonstrate the functionality on some
of the states that have been described in [1] and [2].

Examples

  - hyllus97
    with 3 modes
    with graph { (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2) }

  - hyllus99
    with 3 modes
    with graph { (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3) }

  - nordgren3
    with 3 modes
    with graph { (0, 1), (1, 2) }

  - nordgren4a
    with 4 modes
    with graph { (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) }

  - nordgren4b
    with 4 modes
    with graph { (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3) }
