The concept of genuine multipartite entanglement has been investigated for
discrete quantum systems. We demonstrate the functionality on some of the
states that have been described in [1] and [2].

Examples

  - miklin3a 
    with 3 qubits
    with graph { (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2) }

  - miklin3b 
    with 4 qubits
    with graph { (0, 2), (1, 2) }

  - miklin13
    with 3 qutrits
    with graph { (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2) }

  - miklin4a 
    with 4 qubits
    with graph { (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) }

  - paraschiv4b 
    with 4 qubits
    with graph { (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3) }

  - paraschiv4b-alt 
    with 4 qubits
    with graph { (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3) }

  - paraschiv5a 
    with 5 qubits
    with graph { (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4) }
  
  Evaluation of the 5 qubit example is generally 
  discouraged on slow machines.
